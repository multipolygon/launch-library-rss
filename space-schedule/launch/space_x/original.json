   "title": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Sirius SXM-7",
   "content_text": "SXM-7 is a large high power broadcasting satellite for SiriusXM's digital audio radio service (DARS).\r\n\r\nSpace Systems/Loral (SS/L) got in July 2016 the contract to build the two satellites based on their SSL-1300 bus - SXM-7 and SXM-8. Both operate in the S-band spectrum. Each satellite will generate more than 20-kW of power and will have a large unfurlable antenna reflector, which enables broadcast to radios without the need for large dish-type antennas on the ground.\r\n\r\nSXM-7 is meant to replace the XM-3 satellite.",
