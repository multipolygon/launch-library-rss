They will go through emergency preparedness training, spacesuit and spacecraft ingress and egress exercises, as well as partial and full mission simulations.\r\nThe Crew Dragon spacecraft will remain in a 540 km high orbit for three days before reentering Earth's atmosphere for a soft water landing off the coast of Florida.",
