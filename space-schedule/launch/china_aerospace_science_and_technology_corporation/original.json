   "content_text": "Gaofen (GF) is a series of Chinese civilian remote sensing satellites for the state-sponsored program China High-definition Earth Observation System (CHEOS).\r\n\r\nGF 5 is configured with six types of payloads, including visible and short-wave infra hyper-spectral camera, spectral imager, greenhouse gas detector, atmospheric environment infrared detector at very high spectral resolution, differential absorption spectrometer for atmospheric trace gas, and multi-angle polarization detector, with designed lifespan of 8 years. The satellite is based on the SAST-5000B bus.\r\n\r\nThe instruments are:\r\n\r\n* Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI)\r\n* Visual and Infrared Multispectral Sensor (VIMS)\r\n* Greenhouse-gases Monitoring Instrument (GMI)\r\n* Atmospheric Infrared Ultraspectral (AIUS)\r\n* Environment Monitoring Instrument (EMI)\r\n* Directional Polarization Camera (DPC)",
