   "content_text": "Zhongxing-9B (ChinaSat 9B) is a Chinese communications satellite, that will replace the Zhongxing-9A satellite in orbit. The latter was launched in 2017, but the CZ-3B launch vehicle suffered a partial failure, and the satellite had to burn a large amount of fuel to reach its nominal orbit.\r\n\r\nZX-9B will be used to retransmit television to the Chinese, as well as to provide television communications with Chinese islands, and ships sailing near the coast. The satellite will also be used to broadcast the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in 8K.",
