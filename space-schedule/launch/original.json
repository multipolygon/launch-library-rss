   "title": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)",
   "content_text": "Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is the first-ever mission to demonstrate the capability to deflect an asteroid by colliding a spacecraft with it at high speed â€“ a technique known as a kinetic impactor.\n\nDART is a planetary defense-driven test of one of the technologies for preventing the Earth impact of a hazardous asteroid: the kinetic impactor.  DARTâ€™s primary objective is to demonstrate a kinetic impact on a small asteroid.  The binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the target for DART.   While Didymosâ€™ primary body is approximately 800 meters across, its secondary body (or â€œmoonletâ€) has a 150-meter size, which is more typical of the size of asteroids that could pose a more common hazard to Earth.\n\nThe DART spacecraft will achieve the kinetic impact by deliberately crashing itself into the moonlet at a speed of approximately 6 km/s, with the aid of an onboard camera and sophisticated autonomous navigation software. The collision will change the speed of the moonlet in its orbit around the main body by a fraction of one percent, enough to be measured using telescopes on Earth.",

A secondary function is performance enhancement, increasing the accuracy and reliability of GPS derived navigation solutions.\r\nQZS-1R is a replacement satellite for QZS-1 which was launched in 2010.",
